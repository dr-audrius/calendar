            Create calendar component for month view (similar to Google Calendar).

            These tasks are increasing in complexity, start with the first one:
            1.  Create month view for current date. This includes markup styles and javascript.
                Keep in mind that current month will be different on different dates.
            2.  Highlight current day inside calendar.
            3.  Display sprint events inside calendar days:
                1) Stand-up meeting on every day except weekends;
                2) Planing meeting on Monday every second week starting from first Monday of the month;
                3) Demo meeting on Friday, before next sprint starts;
            4. Add ability to navigate through months of the year (arrows for previous or next month)
            5. Add ability to have events spanning multiple days.
